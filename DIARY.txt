* 24.nov.16

A few days ago I initially worked on Transactions first. The Transaction Form is most verbose, and because amount is an IntegerField, I need a CharField to convert back and forth between amounts in cents or in whole amounts (dollars and cents).

ModelForms do all the work for you.

The last model I worked on was Account: Create and saveCreate

* 24.nov.16

Starting a new app to correct some of the mistakes in Alexie. Will call it benny (after Benjamin Franklin)

$ python manage.py startapp benny

Edit minialexie/settings.py, add benny to INSTALLED_APPS

Edit models.py

$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate

Using exactly the same names in benny creates clashes with existing alexie models. I added related_names to alexie models, then re-ran the migrations.

Edit admin.py

Added default value of Decimal(0) to Account.budget

Wrote tests for benny, adding zero, one, and two transactions

Added r'^benny/' as an url in minialexie/urls.py. Had to restart server.
