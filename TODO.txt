Look for FIXMEs

checkboxes for transactions to delete several at once

Reorder AccountTypes in index in any order (need a new field), drag and drop in right order, reorder accounts in any order (use jQuery UI Sortable)

Pop-up for creating new accounts within Create Transaction, like Admin

When moving accounts to another type, its 'order' must be placed last


Resolved
========

filter to display {{ transaction.amount }} as whole amount, dot and cents - IN BENNY, AMOUNT IS A DECIMAL

Delete should be a method in the model - A FUNCTION IN VIEW

Setting and remembering from/to dates: GET parameters in URL or store in session? - GET PARAMETERS IN URL, CAN BE BOOKMARKED


Wishlist
========

Create account link from AccountType automatically selects the right choice from select box

Use class-based views?
